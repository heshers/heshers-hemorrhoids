Hiding files in pictures (all you have to type is the file, no path. It reads directly from the folder.)
1) Place your target picture, as well as your target folder and place it in the FFC folder.
2) Right click on the target folder and click "Add to" then "Add to %folder%.7z".
3) Run hide_files.bat as Admin.
4) Choose the "Hide a file inside a picture" option.
5) Follow accordingly.
